# skipera
Module to facilitate skipping Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) videos.

## Why?
Skipera assists in automatically skip irrelevant MOOC courses which are made mandatory by universities. 
Many of such courses are allotted directly by the university as a credit filler and not in the in the interest of the student. The progress of the completion of these courses is tracked by the university and credits are allotted.

## How?
Skipera makes use of the Coursera web API and completes the videos + reading materials.
Surveys are not automatically completed since they are graded, thus needing user interaction to complete.
